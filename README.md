@channel MOBILE-DESKTOP TASK
Objective: Develop a mobile application that supports loading and animating two 3D assets (.glb file). This task aims to evaluate your ability to handle 3D assets in a mobile environment, implement interactive animations, and optimize rendering performance. The skills acquired in this task will serve as a foundation for future 3D-intensive projects.
Requirements:
3D Asset Loading: the app should support loading two .glb files.
Both 3D assets should be displayed correctly with proper scaling.
Animation & Interaction: include an animation of the uploaded object.
The movement of the 3D asset should depend on user interaction:
Mobile: Use on-screen buttons to change the direction of the object.
Desktop: Keyboard controls should be implemented:
Arrow keys (Left/Right) to rotate or move the object.
Space bar to make the object jump.
Performance & Optimization: ensure smooth animation transitions.
Optimize rendering for performance and responsiveness.
Asset & Animation Sources: all animations should be sourced from the Ready Player Me Animation Library GitHub Animation Library
All 3D assets should be sourced from the Ready Player Me 3D Library:
3D Avatar Library
Evaluation Criteria:
Basic functionality: The app must load and animate two 3D objects based on user interactions (the objects should face each other to simulate communication between themselves).
Smooth transitions: Animations should not be jarring or abrupt.
Object scaling: The asset should be properly proportioned within the scene.
Optimized rendering: The app should handle rendering efficiently without lag.
Submission Format:
Appetize Link: A publicly accessible link to test the app.
GitHub Repository: A repo with the complete source code.
Video Walkthrough: A Google Drive link demonstrating the appâ€™s functionality.
All submissions must be made publicly accessible.
Bonus Points:
Implement additional interactive gestures or controls.
Include lighting effects or environmental enhancements.
Support multiple 3D asset uploads.
